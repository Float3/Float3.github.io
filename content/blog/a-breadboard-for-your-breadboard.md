1st:buy PCB and electronics seperately it's more difficult but you will learn about0 buying components because you will learn a lot about electronics

This is a blogpost documenting my processes of learning about electronics and specifically analog electronics.

# My start

I have no electronics experience, but I happen to own a soldering iron, a multimeter and some wirecutters.

# The beginning

The very first thing I did for this endeavor is asking some friends for where to start.
I started with asking some friends, [Charles Lohr](https://www.youtube.com/c/CNLohr)
recommended that I buy a guitar pedal PCB and then buy the electronic parts individually,
because figuring out the correct parts to buy is apparently one of the difficulties of electronics.

I then received a warning to be careful to not fry my pickups with incorrects volts/amps.
